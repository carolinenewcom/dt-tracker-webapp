This is the repository for my DT Tracker web application

The DT Tracker is a web application that seeks to provide assistance for Developmental Therapists when tracking attendance percentages. Developmental Therapy is a government funded service provided to parents of children with developmental delays and/or disabilities. To continue to receive funding, the Developmental Therapy programs must maintain at or above an average attendance rate of seventy-five percent. It is crucial for Developmental Therapists to be able to track these percentages so that they may be able to intervene before they fall below the required minimum. Tracking attendance trends can also help Developmental Therapists to better understand the families they are serving which can result in higher quality care. This application aims to provide Developmental Therapists with an easy to access list of their caseload, organized view of their weekly schedule, simple yet precise forms to input attendance data, and immediate visual displays of attendance percentages using graphs.
